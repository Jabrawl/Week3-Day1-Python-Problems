You will also need a class to store your vehicles and handle user input. You can choose attributes and methods as you see fit but you will need the following:\n",

    "- Information about the price of the vehicle.\n",
    "- Information about whether or not the vehicle has been sold. If the vehicle is sold, please note it (maybe a boolean value??) and print out a notification to the console.\n",
    "- Information about the vehicles miles traveled and a method to update these miles.\n",
    "- Come up with at least 2 more attributes and build methods to modify these attributes.\n",
    "- A function to take in user input to create vehicles. Your \"game logic\""
